    # CHANGES ( bn )
    #
    # I've removed all the compounded methods that correspond
    # to the rules.py they used in jfoote/exploitable in favour of just
    # supplying "indicators" than can be combined by higher-level triage
    # tools. That simplifies this code and allows more granular triage and
    # post-processing ( indicators are preserved in the crash information
    # metadata instead of being lost in favour of a single classification )
    #
    # I've stripped a lot of the scaffolding that was used to make the GDB
    # version work as a plugin inside GDB, in favour of making this a simple
    # LLDB standalone tool using the python/SWIG API. This has both good and
    # bad implications, but it's a lot easier to write. Hopefully it can still
    # be folded back into mainline somehow.
